This deprecation is part of a large refactoring effort to transition TorchAudio into a maintenance phase. The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video are being consolidated into TorchCodec. Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information. It will be removed from the 2.9 release. \n","  s = torchaudio.io.StreamReader(src, format, None, buffer_size)\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Val Accuracy: 1.000 | AUC: 1.000\n","Confusion Matrix:\n"," [[20  0]\n"," [ 0 20]]\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","          HC       1.00      1.00      1.00        20\n","          PD       1.00      1.00      1.00        20\n","\n","    accuracy                           1.00        40\n","   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        40\n","weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        40\n","\n"]}],"source":["model = FusionModel(use_transformer=False)\n","train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, epochs=20, lr=1e-4)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Proposed pipeline"],"metadata":{"id":"5P--o7mAiUlP"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":211},"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":44,"status":"error","timestamp":1761834818740,"user":{"displayName":"Uan Chau","userId":"07523315795024060280"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"LiNWJgu1GuYw","outputId":"920ea8d7-36cb-4831-9bd2-a385f28a8f72"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'val_loader' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-1348443290.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmatplotlib\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mpyplot\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mplt\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 6\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mrows\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mval_loader\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m//\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m4\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      7\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mimages\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mwavs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlabels\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mval_loader\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      8\u001b[0m   \u001b[0;31m# Vẽ lưới ảnh\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'val_loader' is not defined"]}],"source":["import math\n","import numpy as np\n","import librosa.display\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","rows= len(val_loader) // 4\n","for images, wavs, labels in val_loader:\n","  # Vẽ lưới ảnh\n","  plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4 * rows))\n","  cols = 4\n","  n_images = images.shape[0]\n","  rows = math.ceil(n_images / cols)\n","\n","  # Chuyển tensor về numpy để hiển thị\n","  images_np = images.permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()  # [B, H, W, C]\n","  images_np = (images_np * 0.5 + 0.5).clip(0, 1)  # khử chuẩn hóa [-1,1] → [0,1]\n","\n","  # Vẽ lưới ảnh\n","  plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4 * rows))\n","  for i in range(n_images):\n","      plt.subplot(rows, cols, i + 1)\n","      plt.imshow(images_np[i])\n","      plt.title(f\"Label: {'PD' if labels[i]==1 else 'HC'}\")\n","      plt.axis(\"off\")"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"mount_file_id":"1ILglJi_qxaA2XWGehzQE0QpduibEvaS-","authorship_tag":"ABX9TyOB9bEJkX3f+FtKz1B1KJNi"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
